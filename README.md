PJCProject 2021v1.0.0
Your main task is to create a console-basedsimulation with ASCII rendering engine.
SimulationDefine rules how something works, some parameters and calculate next state.
ASCII renderingDraw everything as 2D surface using characters only.EngineExtract header and cpp file. 
It will know nothing about your simulation, it cares about rendering only.
The simulationhas to:
•Render ASCII image using terminal•Calculate simulation state
•Use I/O to communicate with user1
•Use I/O assets/ parametersfrom files
•Have an ability to save a screenshot to file
